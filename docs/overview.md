# Project Overview

## Introduction

The fMRI Tool Representation Study is a comprehensive research project that investigates neural representations of graspable objects using modern data engineering practices. This project combines Python analysis pipelines with AFNI neuroimaging workflows to address critical questions in neuroprosthetic rehabilitation and brain-computer interface design.

## Research Motivation

### Clinical Problem
Traditional prosthesis rehabilitation relies on action observation therapy—using visual cortex training to improve motor control in amputees. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying tool representation directly informs:

- **Brain-computer interface design** for prosthetic control
- **Rehabilitation protocols** for motor recovery  
- **Motor imagery training** systems for amputees

### Scientific Question
**Core Research Question:** Are tools special? Do they automatically activate motor representations based on functional identity rather than just graspability?

This study replicates and extends **Creem-Regehr & Lee (2004)** using modern data engineering practices to provide empirical evidence for tool-specific neural representations.

## Experimental Design

### Design Overview
- **Design:** 2×2×2 factorial block design
- **Factors:** Task (Passive Viewing vs Imagined Grasp) × Object Type (Tools vs Shapes) × Graspability
- **Participants:** Representative subject (S01) with complete dataset
- **Total Data Points:** 1,325 trials across all experimental conditions

### Experimental Runs
1. **Run 1 - Passive Viewing (PV)**: Visual attention task (660 trials)
2. **Run 2 - Imagined Grasp (IG)**: Motor imagery task (660 trials)  
3. **Run 3 - Motor Localizer**: Bilateral hand clenching (5 trials)

### Stimulus Design
- **Tools:** 10 common household tools (hair dryer, screwdriver, scissors, etc.)
- **Shapes:** 10 abstract geometric shapes (cone, cube, cylinder, etc.)
- **Scrambled Controls:** Spatially scrambled versions preserving low-level visual properties

**Stimulus Presentation:**
- 8 images per block (2s each)
- 10s interstimulus intervals with fixation cross
- Block sequence: Scrambled Tools → Tools → Scrambled Shapes → Shapes
- 5 repetitions per run for statistical power

## Technical Implementation

### Python Analysis Pipeline
The core analysis leverages a modular, reproducible Python architecture:

### AFNI Neuroimaging Workflow
Complementing the Python pipeline, neuroimaging analysis uses **AFNI (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages)**:

```bash
# Preprocessing Pipeline
3dvolreg -prefix motion_corrected -base vol001 -1Dfile motion_params.1D
3dTshift -prefix slice_timing_corrected
3dmerge -prefix smoothed -1blur_fwhm 6.0

# Statistical Analysis
3dDeconvolve -input preprocessed_data+orig -polort 2 -num_stimts 4
3dREMLfit -matrix design_matrix.1D -input preprocessed_data+orig
```

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Spatial normalization** to Talairach space
- **Motion correction** and smoothing (6mm FWHM)
- **GLM analysis** with General Linear Tests (GLTs)
- **False discovery rate correction** (q < 0.05) for multiple comparisons

## Key Results

### Research Question 1: Are Tools Special?
- **Tools vs Shapes (Passive Viewing):** Significant activation in Lateral Occipital Complex (LOC) and primary/secondary visual cortices
- **Statistical Threshold:** t = 3.5802, p = 3.7×10⁻⁴, q = 0.0111
- **Key Regions:**
  - Lateral Occipital Complex (LOC), V1/V2 (BA 17–18) at MNI (22, 100, -2)
  - Pre/Postcentral Gyrus (BA 3–5) at MNI (10, 44, 70)
- **Interpretation:** Tools recruit visual and somatosensory networks even during passive viewing, indicating early visual areas and somatic mapping networks associated with graspable object perception

### Research Question 2: Action Potentiation  
- **Imagined Grasp vs Passive Viewing:** Robust parietofrontal activation
- **Statistical Threshold:** t = 3.5391, p = 0.0016, q = 0.0199
- **Key Regions:**
  - Left Superior Frontal Gyrus (BA 6) at MNI (-58, 22, 22) - Motor imagery, action planning
  - Superior Parietal Lobule (BA 7) at MNI (24, 50, 54) - Visuomotor integration
  - Lateral Occipital Complex (BA 19) at MNI (24, 90, 24) - Object recognition and shape processing
- **Interpretation:** Motor imagery engages the same networks as real grasping, with parietofrontal activation characteristic of the tool-use network

### Research Question 3: Motor Network Validation
- **Motor Localizer:** Bilateral M1 activation at MNI (-40, 22, 62)
- **Statistical Threshold:** t = 3.7037, p = 2.3×10⁻⁴, q = 0.0047
- **Key Regions:** Primary motor cortex (M1) in Brodmann Area 4, consistent with bilateral motor representation
- **Interpretation:** Successful localization of motor hand area for functional reference, confirming both hemispheres participate in motor representation during bilateral clenching

### Research Question 4: Cross-Modal Integration
- **Average Imagined Grasp vs Passive Viewing:** General parietofrontal activation pattern
- **Statistical Threshold:** t = 3.5391, p = 4.4×10⁻⁴, q = 0.0533
- **Key Regions:**
  - Left Superior Frontal Gyrus (BA 6) at MNI (22, -54, 18) - Motor planning and working memory
  - Brodmann Area 6 (Premotor Cortex) at MNI (22, 10, 68) - Preparation for imagined movement
  - Left Superior Parietal Lobule (BA 7) at MNI (22, 48, 68) - Spatial reasoning and motor imagery integration
- **Interpretation:** Consistent engagement of the parietofrontal network across both shape and tool conditions, reinforcing that imagined grasping drives motor-related activation patterns
