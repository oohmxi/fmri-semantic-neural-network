# Stimuli

This directory contains all stimulus materials used in the fMRI Tool Representation Study.

## Directory Structure

- `tools/` - Functional tool images (screwdriver, knife, pliers, etc.)
- `shapes/` - Neutral graspable geometric shapes (cone, cube, cylinder, etc.)
- `scr_tools/` - Screen-optimized tool images for MRI display
- `scr_shapes/` - Screen-optimized shape images for MRI display
- `condition_files/` - CSV files defining stimulus conditions and timing

## Stimulus Categories

### Tools
Functional objects with handles that afford specific actions:
- Screwdriver
- Knife
- Pliers
- Flashlight
- Hair dryer
- Razor
- Scissors
- Fry pan
- Hair brush
- Nail clipper

### Shapes
Neutral graspable geometric forms:
- Cone
- Cube
- Cylinder
- Sphere
- Pyramid
- Dodecahedron
- Icosahedron
- Pentagonal prism

- Torus

## Screen Optimization

SCR (Screen) variants are high-contrast versions optimized for display in the MRI environment, ensuring visibility and consistency across participants.

## Condition Files

CSV files define the experimental conditions:
- `SCRtool.csv.xlsx` - Screen-optimized tools
- `tools.csv.xlsx` - Standard tools
- `SCRshapes.csv.xlsx` - Screen-optimized shapes
- `shape.csv.xlsx` - Standard shapes
